Employee Turnover Prediction - Classification
This project tackles the challenge of predicting employee turnover within an organization using machine learning techniques.

What is Employee Turnover?

Employee turnover refers to the rate at which employees leave a company within a specific period, usually a year. High turnover can have significant negative impacts on a company's productivity, morale, and overall success.

Predicting Employee Turnover

This project focuses on building models that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization in the coming period. By analyzing various employee data points, we aim to identify patterns and factors that influence employee retention.

Benefits of Employee Turnover Prediction:

Proactive Workforce Management: Predicting potential departures allows companies to plan for recruitment well in advance, avoiding staffing gaps and ensuring smooth operations.
Improved Employee Retention: By understanding the key drivers of turnover, companies can address underlying issues and implement strategies to create a more positive and engaging work environment, ultimately reducing turnover rates.
Target Variable:

This project focuses on a binary classification problem. The target variable is "left" which indicates whether an employee has left the organization within the defined timeframe.

This repository contains code, data (if applicable), and resources for building and evaluating models to predict employee turnover. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to equip companies with valuable insights for managing their workforce and fostering a culture that retains top talent.
